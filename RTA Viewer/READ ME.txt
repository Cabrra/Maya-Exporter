This is the new ED2 viewer that you can also test your binary and .scn files with.

To run test this application:

1. Run
2. Load File
3. Bask in your glory

Any .mesh or .xml file you load with it, please make sure the appropriate texture is in the 
textures folder.

If testing a scene, make sure that all meshes (.xml format) are located in the meshes folder.
Otherwise there will be problems.

This is a pre Alpha build and I'm sure there are probably bugs. Just let me know and I'll 
do what I can for future builds.
